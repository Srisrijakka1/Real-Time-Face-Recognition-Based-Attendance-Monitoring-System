## Real-Time-Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-Monitoring-System
              This Repository contains the software required For REAL TIME FACE RECOGNITION BASED ATTENDANCE MONITORING SYSTEM.
              This Repository is a open source for learners and developers for reference to developing a new software for Digital Attendance System in Educational Institutes ,Offices,..etc. 
              This Repository also helpful in developing high secure Login based on face recognition.

# Requirements for this project:
              A google account > for colab access
                               > google drive to store the whole project related data.
              High Resolution webcamera.For this project 1080MP camera gives more better capturing results compared to less resolution cameras. 


# Adventages of this Project:
              In this Project the webcam will capture the Real time data of video.so this model is called Real time based model.
              This Project then automatically capture the photo frame of video where if the Face is Detected in the Photo frame.
              Then the Photo is tested against the anti-spoofing model to verify the photo captured is "Real" or "Spoof"
              If the photo captured is Real then the Photo frame is moved furthur for Face Recognition Based on databased loaded images at known_faces_dir.
              If a Match of a photo was found in database of known_faces_dir then the Attendance is Marked in the database and the Login students data.
              Then to provide acknowledgement to the Parents or Gaurdians.we have added a feature called automatic mailing.so this project also provide acknowledgement.
              This project also uses the GoogleDrive as a storage and Google Colab for Execution.So it is a cloud based model.

# Project Practical Usecases:
             This model is efficient accurate for using small oraganisations to big multinational Organisations.
             This model is recomended for Educational Institutions for Attendance Management.
             This model is better to use in banks to improve security for seceret rooms.
             This model is one of the best suitable in military zones at enterence to control the unauthorised entry.
             This model is useful in everywhere in real life from Automatic home entry sytem to entry in Rockets launcing places.
